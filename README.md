# PCB Design Portfolio

This repository contains a curated set of PCB design projects developed for instructional use and technical mentorship. The designs demonstrate practical workflows in schematic capture, hierarchical design, PCB layout, and manufacturability using KiCad and EAGLE.

While many of these projects were created for teaching purposes, they reflect real-world PCB design practices and increasing levels of technical complexity.
