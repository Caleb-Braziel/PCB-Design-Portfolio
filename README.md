# PCB Design Portfolio

This repository contains a curated set of PCB design projects developed for instructional use and technical mentorship. The designs demonstrate practical workflows in schematic capture, hierarchical design, PCB layout, and manufacturability using KiCad and EAGLE.

While many of these projects were created for teaching purposes, they reflect real-world PCB design practices and increasing levels of technical complexity.

## Project Overview

The projects in this repository span a range of complexity, from introductory designs to advanced power and embedded systems.

### EAGLE Projects
- **Night Light PCB**  
  A simple, fully fabricated and hand-soldered PCB used to teach schematic capture, layout fundamentals, and design-for-manufacturing concepts.

### KiCad Projects
- **AC to DC Converter**  
  A mains-powered AC to DC conversion circuit emphasizing power electronics safety, isolation, filtering, and PCB layout considerations.

- **DC Motor Speed Controller**  
  A PWM-based motor controller highlighting inductive load handling, grounding strategies, and power-stage layout.

- **GPS Tracker with STM32**  
  A multi-sheet embedded system integrating an STM32 microcontroller and GPS module, demonstrating hierarchical schematic organization and mixed-signal design practices.

- **300W Sine Wave Inverter (EGS002)**  
  A high-power inverter design focused on high-current routing, thermal considerations, and separation of control and power domains.
